# About

This is a template of a web application in which a user can create news that are displayed in a nice layout. It is somewhat similar to a blog.

# Built with

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/);
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/);
- [EJS](https://ejs.co/).

# To do

- Add functionality to the search bar;
- Include routes to edit/delete posts;
- Upload a live version to the web.

# Observations

- Maybe someday I'll re-write the frontend using React, just to try it out, and use a database to save data.
